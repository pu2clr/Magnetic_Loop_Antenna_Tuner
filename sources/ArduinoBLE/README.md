#  Arduino with  a HM10 (HMSoft) BLE

__So far, I could not develope a Mobile Application for Android and iOS to work with this magnetic antenna tunner. I'm still working on it.__ However, if you have a BLE device,  you can replace the HC-05 or similar to you BLE device. 
Istead of the Android Application developed for this project, you can use a regular Bluetooth Application like HM10 Bluetooth Serial for iOS or Serial Bluetooth Terminal for Android. With these application, you can control your tunner remotely. 


The photos below show the HM10 Bluetooth device (BLE), Android and iOS Aplications
