#  Arduino with  a HM10 (HMSoft) BLE

So far, I could not develope a Mobile Application for Android and iOS to work with this magnetic antenna tunner. I'm still working on it. However, if you have a BLE device,  you can replace the HC-05 or similar to you BLE device. 
Istead of the Android Application developed for this project, you can use a regular Bluetooth Application like HM10 Bluetooth Serial for iOS or Serial Bluetooth Terminal for Android. With these application, you can control your tunner remotely.
