#  Arduino and Android Application codes

All Arduino and Android Application codes are avaiable here.  


## Android Application

If you want to use the Android Application without any modification, you can install the binary located at __AndroidApplication/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/__ folder ([click here to download the apk](https://github.com/pu2clr/Magnetic_Loop_Antenna_Tuner/blob/master/sources/AndroidApplication/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk)).  However, it is recomended to use the [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) to modify, build and deploy the aplication.

## Arduino Sketch

The [ArduinoOneCapacitor folder](https://github.com/pu2clr/Magnetic_Loop_Antenna_Tuner/tree/master/sources/ArduinoOneCapacitor) has the [Arduino sketch](https://github.com/pu2clr/Magnetic_Loop_Antenna_Tuner/blob/master/sources/ArduinoOneCapacitor/ArduinoOneCapacitor.ino). 

The sketch is documented and can help you to understand the protocol used to communicate with Android Device. Please, Dropout (disconnect) the Bluetooth from Arduino to upload this sketch to Arduino. After upload, connect again the Bluetooth to Arduino. 

__The bluetooth shield have to be desconected during the sketch upload process__.
