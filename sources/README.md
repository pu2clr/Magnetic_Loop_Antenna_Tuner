#  Arduino and Android Application codes

All Arduino and Android Application codes are avaiable here.  


## Android Application

If you want to use the Android Application without any modification, you can install the binary located at __AndroidApplication/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/__ folder ([click here to download the apk](https://github.com/pu2clr/Magnetic_Loop_Antenna_Tuner/blob/master/sources/AndroidApplication/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk)).  However, it is recomended to use the [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) to modify, build and deploy the aplication.

## Arduino Sketch

The [ArduinoOneCapacitor folder](https://github.com/pu2clr/Magnetic_Loop_Antenna_Tuner/tree/master/sources/ArduinoOneCapacitor) has the [Arduino sketch](https://github.com/pu2clr/Magnetic_Loop_Antenna_Tuner/blob/master/sources/ArduinoOneCapacitor/ArduinoOneCapacitor.ino). 

__The bluetooth shield have to be desconected during the sketch upload process__.
